<h3> HISTORY OF MUSIC</h3>
<p>
Music history, a vast and fascinating field, explores the evolution of music across cultures and time, encompassing various eras, styles, and technological advancements.
 From ancient musical practices to modern genres, music history provides insights into<u> human creativity, cultural expression, and societal changes</u>. The music of prehistori
 cultures is first firmly dated to c. 40,000 BP of the Upper Paleolithic by evidence of bone flutes, though it remains unclear whether or not the actual origins lie in the earlier
 Middle Paleolithic period (300,000 to 50,000 BP). There is little known about prehistoric music, with traces mainly limited to some simple flutes and percussion instruments
. However, such evidence indicates that music existed to some extent in prehistoric societies such as the Xia dynasty and the Indus Valley civilisation. Upon the development
 of writing,<b><i> the music of literate civilizations—ancient music—was present in the major Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Indian, Persian, Mesopotamian, and Middle Eastern societies</i></b>
. It is difficult to make many generalizations about ancient music as a whole, but from what is known it was often characterized by monophony and improvisation. In ancient 
song forms, the texts were closely aligned with music, and though the oldest extant musical notation survives from this period, many texts survive without their accompanying 
music, such as the Rigveda and the Shijing Classic of Poetry. The eventual emergence of the Silk Road and increasing contact between cultures led to the transmission and exchange
 of musical ideas, practices, and instruments. Such interaction led to the Tang dynasty's music being heavily influenced by Central Asian traditions, while the Tang dynasty's music, 
the Japanese gagaku and Korean court music each influenced each other.

Historically, religions have often been catalysts for music. The Vedas of Hinduism immensely influenced Indian classical music, and the Five Classics of Confucianism laid the basis
 for subsequent Chinese music. Following the rapid spread of Islam in the 7th century, Islamic music dominated Persia and the Arab world, and the Islamic Golden Age saw the
 presence of numerous important music theorists. Music written for and by the early Christian Church properly inaugurates the Western classical music tradition,[1] which continues 
into medieval music where polyphony, staff notation and nascent forms of many modern instruments developed. In addition to religion or the lack thereof, a society's music is
 influenced by all other aspects of its culture, including social and economic organization and experience, climate, and access to technology. Many cultures have coupled music 
with other art forms, such as the Chinese four arts and the medieval quadrivium. The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened 
to, and the attitudes toward musicians and composers all vary between regions and periods. Many cultures have or continue to distinguish between art music (or 'classical music'), 
folk music, and popular music.

Vedic period
The origin of Indian music has been described through myth, without giving weight to actual historical authenticity and often attributing responsibility for the existence of this human
 activity to the divine. From a Western point of view it is unacceptable to think that God has transmitted this knowledge to men, but from an exclusively doctrinal point of view this is 
the only truth. Brahma, God of creation, taught Shiva, God of transformation, who passed this art to Saraswati, Goddess of knowledge, music and the arts. In turn the art was taught
 to Narad, who is credited with the invention of the Veena, who taught this art to the Gandharvas (Celestial Singers), Kinnar (Celestial Instrumentalists) and Apsaras (Celestial Dancers)
. Finally the two famous Rishis, Hanuman and Narada gave this knowledge to the whole earth. <i><u>Some attribute to the god Shiva the paternity of five Ragas: Bhairava, Hindol, Megh, 
Deepak and Shri, a sixth, Kaishik, is attributed to Parvati, Shiva's companion</u></i>. There are theories that simplify this tradition by declaring that all music arose from the sacred syllable
 AUM (OM), and this is the most probable of all. Regardless of myths, legends and religious dogmas, the phylogeny of Indian music finds ancient roots in the civilizations of the Indus
 Valley.

Based on the excavations carried out by the Department of Archeology of India of the Indus Valley Civilisation, this is considered to be prior to the Vedic Civilisation. Representations 
of dancers and musicians emerged from the excavations, particularly in the excavations of Harappa and Mohanjodaro, giving evidence of the diffusion of such intellectual activities,
 probably already of a high level.Traditionally, the Vedic Period coincides with the rise to power of the Aryans, a population probably coming from Central Asia, in India. The Vedic
 period left a very important imprint on Indian culture, in particular through the Vedic literature composed of the Rig Veda, Yajurva Veda, Sam Veda and Atharva Veda. The Riga Veda
 is considered the oldest and is dated to 2500 BC, but these datings leave no time, given that the tradition was essentially oral and therefore it is impossible to establish a starting
 date. Furthermore, the Vedas have always existed, since before creation.Music was very popular during the Vedic period. The vocal, instrumental or dance performance had already
 reached high levels, the 'mass' was nourished culturally. These arts probably accompanied the rituals of domestic and/or public religiosity, as still happens today. In fact it must be
 recognized that these arts are rituals and not entertainment. The dance was practiced by both sexes.

The instruments were classified into the following categories:
<ul type="square">
<li>Tata Vadya or Chordophones: The stringed instruments that were played with bow, plectrum or plucked with fingers. Veena, Kand Veena, Karkari Veena are mentioned.</li>

<li> Avanaddha Vadya or Membranophones: These are instruments that have a membrane stretched over a cylinder, the body of which can close or open at various distances from the stretched skin.</li>

<li>Sushir Vadya or Aerophones: These are instruments whose sound is stimulated by the air induced by the musician. Bansuri and Shennai are mentioned.</li>

<li>  Ghan Vadya or Idiophones: instruments that produce sound from the vibration of the body of the instrument itself. Examples include Jhanj, Kartal, Kanjeera.</li>
